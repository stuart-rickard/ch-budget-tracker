# Budget Tracker

Budget Tracker is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) submitted in response to the challenge assignment for Module 19 of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp of the UC Berkeley Extension. The challenge provided starter code which tracks a budget. The challenge required modifying the code to make it a PWA -- specifically: adding a service worker, a web manifest, and use of IndexedDB to store data while offline -- and required deploying the code to Heroku. MongoDB is used to store data on the server.

## Notes

Converting the starter code into a PWA is an interesting exercise, but the end product of this challenge is a little unsatisfying as it is not useful for much. Nevertheless, the code can be used as a model for a more-useful PWA.

Note that PWA's are not equally well-supported by every operating system. For example, support on iOS, which runs Apple's iPhone line, is limited, while support on Android phones is better.
